In October 2017 the Shared Data Hub [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41556997) that the proportion of EU nationals leaving jobs in the NHS is rising, while the share of those joining is shrinking.

The figures do not include data for GPs and practice staff or Clinical Commissioning Groups, and concern headcount rather than full-time equivalent posts.

The Shared Data Hub makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association. Stories generated by the partnership included:
